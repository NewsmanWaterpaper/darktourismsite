    <h1>What's the deal?</h1>
    
    <p>So. Area 51 does indeed exist (officially now). It’s also part of an active military base, patrolled and guarded by some of the heaviest security on Earth or anywhere else. That means what it’s NOT is a tourist attraction. If you find yourself close by, obey all posted signs and don’t even think about trespassing. You will be caught and you will be prosecuted (at the very least). Even worse, you might even end up being meme-ified for all eternity. And let’s be real, no selfie or amount of likes are worth that kind of headache.</p>
    
    <p>The first report of UFOs at Area 51, tucked within the Nevada Test and Training Range, surfaced in 1955. People mistook test flights of the Air Force’s covert U-2 airplane for an alien invasion, and the government wasn’t about to correct them. The Soviets were watching, after all, and the feds wanted the plane kept quiet. The legend of Area 51 grew from there.</p>

    <p>Visitors cannot actually venture into Area 51 — the Air Force is pretty touchy about any attempts to breach its training-range barriers, identified with fencing and, no kidding, motion detectors. Travelers have to settle for merely getting close to the site, which brave ones can approach near the Groom Lake salt flat.</p>
