    <h1>Tourist Attraction?</h1>
    
    <p>So. Area 51 does indeed exist (officially now). It’s also part of an active military base, patrolled and guarded by some of the heaviest security on Earth or anywhere else. That means what it’s NOT is a tourist attraction. If you find yourself close by, obey all posted signs and don’t even think about trespassing. You will be caught and you will be prosecuted (at the very least). Even worse, you might even end up being meme-ified for all eternity. And let’s be real, no selfie or amount of likes are worth that kind of headache.</p>
