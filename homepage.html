            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Dark Tours was set up in January 2019 by John, Ness and Ben with aims of providing a service for a rather niche sector of the worldwide tourism industry.</p>
            
            <p>With the rise of the internet, the knowledge and interest in the Dark Corners of the Earth has also increased as well as the demand to be able to travel to such places. We at Dark Tours hope to full that Void in the market and provide a easy-to-use and cheap service to those who wish to travel to the most inhospitable and eerie places in the world. </p>
